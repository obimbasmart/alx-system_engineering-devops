# Networking basics #0

I've gained a wealth of knowledge in networking, including insights into how the internet operates, the OSI model, MAC, and IP addresses, as well as UDP and TCP protocol suites. This newfound understanding is invaluable.

# Mandatory tasks

`4-TCP_and_UDP_ports` - Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:

- That only shows listening sockets
- That shows the `PID `and name of the program to which each socket belongs


`5-is_the_host_on_the_network` - Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
  
- Accepts a string as an argument
- Displays `Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}` if no argument passed
- Ping the IP 5 times
